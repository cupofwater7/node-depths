# node-depths
Difficulty: easy


  The distance between a node in a Binary Tree and the tree's root is called the
  node's depth. Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns the sum of its nodes'
  depths. Each BinaryTree node has an integer value, a left child node, and a right child node. Children
  nodes can either be BinaryTree nodes themselves or None / null.
